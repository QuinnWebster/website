            This is a project that I developped to help teach my fundamental skills in web development. This was a fun project for me to make because I love playing cribbage and I wanted to make a tool that would help me improve my game. </p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Developed to enhance your cribbage playing experience, this project offers a user-friendly interface where players can input their hand's six cards and receive instant recommendations on which cards to keep and discard to maxami scoring potential.</p>
