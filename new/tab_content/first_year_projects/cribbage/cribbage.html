        <h1>Cribbage Hand Optimizer</h1>
        <p>
            The Cribbage Hand Optimizer project is designed to help players improve their cribbage strategy by recommending which cards to keep and discard to maximize hand points.        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for this project came to me during a cribbage game with my Dad. We were debating the highest possible points from both the hand and the crib, and I thought, "I could write a program to figure that out." So I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, I developed the program in Java, allowing users to input their hands through the terminal. It worked well, providing recommendations on which cards to keep. However, I wanted to improve its usability by adding a user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was my first experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the learning curve was steep. I began by rewriting the card-selection algorithm in JavaScript and then I built a simple UI where users can select their hand by clicking on the cards they hold. The app then recommends the best cards to keep, adjusting based on whether it's the user's crib or not.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The project was a fun learning experience and has become a tool my Dad and I continue to use while playing cribbage. 
        </p>
