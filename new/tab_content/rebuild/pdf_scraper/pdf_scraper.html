        <h1>PDF scraper</h1>

        <p>
            During my internship, I was tasked with designing and developing a tool to extract and organize data from energy compliance report PDFs submitted to municipalites across British Columbia.
            These reports contain important information about energy information for new buildings and retrofits.
            My role was to create an automated pipeline to extract data from these reports and organize it into an Excel database.
            This was a unqiue opportunity, as I was given full freedom to design and implement the tool as I saw fit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started by exploring different libraries and tools that could help me extract text and data from PDFs. However, there were four different revisions of the reports, and amongts those revisions,
            the reports were not standardized, and the data was not always in the same location or format. This made it difficult to extract the data using traditional methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first prototype involved converting the PDFs to images and using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text from the images into a text file.
            I then would search the text file for specific keywords and extract the data around those keywords. This method worked decently well for the first revision; however, it was somewhat inacurate.
            Also, this appraoch of finding key words was not effective for the other revisions of the reports due to complicated tables and layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second prototype involved converting the PDFs to images, and then using a dynamic zonal OCR tool to extract the data from specific regions of the images.
            This approach worked well because across each revision, allthough the size and spacing changed slightly, the data was in the same location corresponding to the PDFs dimensions.

            I structured the project into three main parts:

        </p>

        <li class="custom-list">
            <ul>
                PDF Preprocessing: Converted PDFs into images and categorized them based on the revision.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                mage Preparation: Cropped the images to focus on relevant content and sorted them by report type.
            </ul>      
            <ul>
                Data Extraction: Used OCR to extract text from the images and export it into Excel sheets.
            </ul> 
        </li>

        <p>
            This project was a blend of Python programming, OCR integration, and data structuring, and it provided valuable insights into automating complex data extraction processes from unstructured formats like PDFs. The end result was a highly organized system that could process batches of compliance reports and deliver structured, actionable data for future analysis.

Working on this tool deepened my understanding of data pipelines, OCR libraries, and how to handle varying document formats programmatically, all while contributing to a meaningful project aimed at improving energy efficiency policy in British Columbia.
